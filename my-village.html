    <P>
        This kind of dance is known as "Dombolo" which makes the village special.Everyone has to wear their traditional
        clothes which made of some leaf called "harefo".We open a party by doing this dance.Actually, there are some
        teenagers who are already in a team so they have rehearsed for a very long time.

        Most people in my town are farmers especially in the small village.This task is only for a women.Sometimes,men
        can take part in it as well.
