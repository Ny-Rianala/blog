      <h2>My family</h2>
      <p>
      I am Kati. I am from Kelilalina, it belongs to the district Ifanadina, which is part of Vatovavy-Fitovinany Region. I have 7 siblings, 3 brothers and 4 sisters. Most of them are still studying.

      <h3>My study</h3>
      <p>
        Before, I lived with my family and I enjoyed living with them, and I studied in Kelilalina until I got my Bacc degree. Now, I study at Onja, it is in Mahanoro which is part of the East-Cost. I have been here since last year. We have an English and Coding course during two years. I love this place because it was so nice and quite peaceful.
