        How do we celebrate the party?

      <p>
        First of all, all the women have to prepare themselves before the party starts.<br> What I mean by preparing is, they have their own theme, dance, each village. <br> Even they make up their faces too.

        During the parade everyone has different themes for the way of clothing.<br> It depends on where they are from,that means there are many types of tribes in Madagascar,<br> so they follows that as well.<br> Then, they go to the city hall or a place where it is held. <br>There must be a speech. The party will be ended by performing.<br>
        Besides, it is not only seeing them celebrating but knowing  that we all have the same right. <br> I hope, you would enjoy reading this page. Thanks.
