        Hello! â˜º I would like to share about the nature. I really love nature and I think you will be interested in it as well.

        Sometimes, we think about something which is really big when we hear the term "nature". However, it is not that idea, it can be small thing but it has its life too.

        Have a look at this wonderful creature.This kind of flower is only seen on the side of beach. Its season is in spring. It is impressing because it must drop on the ground after it flourishes.
        How amazing it is! It just live in a short time in its life and then it falls. Walking through the trees and seeing them under the trees is so lively.
