        Hello! â˜º I would like to share about the nature. I really love nature and I think you too will be interested in it.</p>

        Sometimes, we think about something really big when hear the term "nature". However, it is not that idea, it can be small thing but it has its life too.     </p>

        Have a look at this wonderful creature.This kind of flower is only seen in the beach. Its season is at the begining of the year. It is impressing because it must drop in the ground after it flourishes.
        How amazing it is! It just live in a short time in its life and then it falls. Walking through the trees and seeing them under the trees is so lively.
